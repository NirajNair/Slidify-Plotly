Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

I have used 'mtcars' dataset to plot a graph using plotly.
I have ploted mpg vs cyl in the 'mtcars' dataset to understand the change of mpg on different cylinder types.

---

```{r , echo=F, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
data("mtcars")
mtcars$cyl <- factor(mtcars$cyl)
p <- plot_ly(data = mtcars, type = 'box', x = mtcars$cyl, y = mtcars$mpg, color = mtcars$cyl)
p <- p %>% layout(xaxis = list(title= 'Cylinders'), yaxis = list(title= 'Miles Per Gallon'))
p
htmlwidgets::saveWidget(as_widget(p), "wp.html")

```
